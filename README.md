**What concrete benefits did you see by utilizing AI to help you make the notebook?**

The benefits that I saw while utilizing AI was that it was much faster to get code, I could pretty much ask it anything, and it could explain things in more detail for when I didn't understand something as much. I think that using AI for things that take time, or for explaing something that you don't understand can be very beneficail. I have used AI before to explain syntax to me and show me differnt examples, which I feel was very helpful when putting what I was learning to use.

**What dangers do you see for someone using AI to make this notebook without
learning data science properly? Give concrete examples**

I definitely can see there being dangers for someone using AI to make a notbook like this. If one does that they many not fully learn anything that is supposed to be learned in the notebook. I also think that this goes not only for this assingment but all assignments where you are trying to learn something. I know that if I didn't already know what KNN was, I wouldn't have any idea what it meant or was doing in this assignment. This shows that when trying to learn its probably best to only use AI to explain things when needed. 

**Give examples where you needed to verify the AI output for correctness. How did
you know to verify those outputs?**

There were some graphs that showed interesting outcomes that I felt might've been off, so had to check those. I also wanted to check the results of the numbers that was in the dataset, as I was worried it wasn't in the notebook correctly.
